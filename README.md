🚀 Project Highlight: Student Assistant Employment Chatbot (Built in Under 1 Hour)
 Last week, I developed a fully functional chatbot powered by OpenAI, Pinecone, and n8n—and deployed it through Telegram—in just 60 minutes.

🛠️ Solo project, done as part of an internal proof-of-concept to streamline HR communication for student employment policies.

📘 The chatbot is trained strictly on the CSULB Student Assistant Employment Handbook (Feb 2024) and built with strong guardrails to:

●	Answer only what’s in the official document

●	Auto-decline unrelated or out-of-scope questions

●	Maintain HR compliance and policy clarity

🔎 Key Tools & Stack:
●	n8n for low-code automation and orchestration

●	Pinecone for real-time vector search

●	OpenAI embeddings (with custom prompt logic)

●	Telegram for the user-facing chatbot

●	n8n Web App for complete flow control

⚠️ Fun Debug: I initially missed setting the correct embedding dimension (512) for OpenAI — quick fix, lesson learned!

✅ Use case: Designed for a test environment, this chatbot is modular and easily extendable across other departments or policy documents.
